I have learned to help with if you push the pen to hard and struggle with doing it without realizing get a big flat sponge or a soft foam that is flat put the paper on it and if you push to hard yes it will push through the paper but will teach you the lighter you push the softer the lines are and it helps in sketching when you need soft lines
If you push hard maybe a pencil gripper there are some that actually help with positioning your fingers and sometimes because of your holding a pencil wrong it can make your push harder (from what i do i learned because i use to hold my pencil wrong and i would push harder so i had some sort on grip and it was because i was holding it wrong)
There is pencils made for sketching that a effects the lines of your worl and there is mechanical pencils that adjust the the lead size and that can help alot if your a beginner 
When you are learning to shake with colored pencils, markers, or anything make sure its something you can do because each marker and colored pencil are diffrent and even if it says the same shade always test it because there is in alohol markers in one pack it says same color same name but its a diffrent shade and color pencils sometimes have a wax coat and the first try wont work because you need to shaprpen it
I would say learn traditional before digital but I promise there is no right or wrong way people have their prefrences and thats ok you choose what you like and who knows maybe later that opinion will change
(you dont have to but it helps alot when a beginner) Always get the artist glove for anything trust me for digital or traditional in traditional i have learn it prevents smudging and in digital it is to the skin doesnt mess it up (their are some that are like 10 dollars and some are 10 aswell and has cool designs its what you choose and in your budget it helps alot)
to blend in traditional there is several meathods and even a paper pen made like a paper lolipop stick that does it or you can use a q-tip, your finger if ya dont mind the mess, or even adding up slowly colored pencil slowly mixing it by building it uo
It is ok to refrence a drawing but do not make it one for one, or trace, or way way to similar but like using the hair style, make the clothes style similar, the body pose
Everything even small body parts are easier to make when making shapes evrything in art starts as a shape and you slowly make it what it is every joint, every thing in you look at your body use your imagination (some people struggle it so look up a body sketch with shapes or take a picture of your body and use something to draw over it and make shapes) this helps alot and even big artist use this to make the bodies, face, eyes, and everything
if you wanna like the body, animal ears, tail, nose, teeth start by making a sketch base and learn it over and over and over till you are confident and happy (this can vary on body types and gender so practice and practice till you are confident)
